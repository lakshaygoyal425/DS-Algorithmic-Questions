This is the collection of **Algorithms, Data Structures** and **Interview Questions** with solutions.
This repository contains my solutions for common algorithmic problems and implementation of Data Structures in C/C++.
I've created this repository to learn about algorithms. I am adding solutions continuously. 


**Algorithms,  Data Structures** and **more than 400 Problems and Solutions** are provided so far.
